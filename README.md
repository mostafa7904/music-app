## Rules

There are some simple rules before you contribute

- If you are adding any images make sure they are optimized ([image optimization process](#image-optimazation))
- You can add any song you want from the source in the code (no worries about copyright)
- If possible do not add any external libraries

## Image Optimazation

1.  [Make sure the size is correct](https://ezgif.com/resize)
2.  [Optimize with lossy setting](https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression)
3.  [Convert to webp](https://ezgif.com/png-to-webp)

## Note

This project is under development so expect any bugs.

The structure of the website might look weird but you should know that I'm trying to build this website without a backend. Therefore everything has to be done in the front-end. Music streaming apps are very different in the real world.

yarn install
