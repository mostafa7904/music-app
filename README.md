## Image Optimazation

If you want to add any images make sure they are optimized

1.  [Make sure the size is correct](https://ezgif.com/resize)
2.  [Optimize with lossy setting](https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression)
3.  [Convert to webp](https://ezgif.com/png-to-webp)

## Note

This project is under development so expect any bugs.

The structure of the website might look weird but you should know that I'm trying to build this website without a backend. Therefore everything has to be done in the front-end. Music streaming apps are very different in the real world.
